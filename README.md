After generating parser files, you need to generate a .flex file from the same .bnf file, right click to file and choose option **Generate JFlex Lexer** and generate **_LatteLexer.flex** in the same folder.

Now you can build plugin using gradle, and it will automatically generate another classes from .flex files, if you want you can help us automate system, so next time no one must do the manual generation work.
```$xslt
$ gradlew build
```

To build `.jar` file to local install to IDE run gradle task `buildPlugin`. `.jar` file with plugin will be located in `build/libs`


Run IDE for testing
-------------------

Create file `local.properties` in project and insert next content with path to IDE directory:

For your current OS see `default IDE paths`: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tuning-the-ide.html#default-dirs

```
runIdeDirectory = /Users/<user id>/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/PhpStorm/ch-0/201.7223.96/PhpStorm 2019.3 EAP.app/Contents
```

And run gradle task `:runIde` ideally by run configurations in IDEA (it supports debugging).
